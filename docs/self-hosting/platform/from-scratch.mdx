# Deploy LobeChat from Scratch

This tutorial will guide you through deploying LobeChat from scratch. We will use `pnpm` for dependency installation and server startup.

<Steps>

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that your system has the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (recommended to use the latest LTS version)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (can be installed via `npm`: `npm install -g pnpm`)

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the LobeChat repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lobehub/lobe-chat.git
cd lobe-chat
```

### Install Dependencies

Use `pnpm` to install the required dependencies for the project:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Build the Project

Before starting the server, you need to build the project:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Start the Server

Start the LobeChat server using the following command:

```bash
pnpm start
```

### Access the Application

Once the server is running, you can access the LobeChat welcome page in your browser at `http://localhost:3210`.

</Steps>
